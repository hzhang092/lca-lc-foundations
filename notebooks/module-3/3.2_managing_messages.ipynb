Fair Compensation & Benefits**\\n- **Issue:** Pay is tied to cheese yield, which fluctuates with lunar dust storms and mineral vein depletion.\\n- **Solution:**  \\n  - Introduce a **Guaranteed Lunar Wage (GLW)** — a base salary indexed to Earth’s inflation + hazard pay multiplier (3.5x standard).  \\n  - Offer **Cheese Miner Retirement Bonds** — 10% of each cheese crate sold funds a pension pool for miners after 15 years of service.\\n\\n#### **C.

Voice & Representation**\\n- **Issue:** Union feels ignored; decisions made by Earth-based bureaucrats.\\n- **Solution:**  \\n  - Create the **Lunapolis Miner’s Council** — 15 elected miners (including women and non-binary miners) with **veto power** over habitat design, safety protocols, and export quotas.  \\n  - Establish a **Miner’s Ombudsman** — an independent watchdog funded by the Lunar Treasury, not the mining corporation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **3.
